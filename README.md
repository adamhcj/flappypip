## What it currently is:
A music button that plays pokemon music (now it is in the form of a piplup button at the top right corner)<br>
Music button cycles through music.<br>
Has a piplup sprite that says "piplup!" when you tap it.<br>
The piplup object has gravity properties and can jump when tapped.<br>
Score system, every time player passes a wall, score adds by 1.<br>
Whenever player touches ground or wall, score resets to 0.<br>
Hitbox painted in red for now
