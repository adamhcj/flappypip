### disclaimer: made game easier and less rage-inducing, so that player is able to explore the music button and play at their own pace (removed death mechanics, instead the score goes down by 1 if player touches the wall. The point is gained back when the wall exits the frame. The only way to get negative points is player colliding with both top and bottom wall per set of walls spawned.)

## What it currently is:
A music button that plays pokemon music (now it is in the form of a piplup button at the top right corner)<br>
Music button cycles through music.<br>
Has a piplup sprite that says "piplup!" when you tap it.<br>
The piplup object has gravity properties and can jump when tapped.<br>
Score system, every time player passes a wall, score adds by 1.<br>
Whenever player touches ground or wall, score resets to 0.<br>
Hitbox painted in red for now
